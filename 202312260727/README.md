* Maintain a 6-month reserve of cash for emergency. Utilize all other cash
  - Savings balance should be $41k

* Purchase as many as possible series I bonds; chat with Daniel about these
* When CDs mature, talk to Daniel about moving out of CDs and into a split
  stocks + bonds strategy. Consider index funds + treasury bonds

## Professional
* Work towards promotion; before Namrata leaves, I want to schedule some time
  with her to figure out what steps I should pursue when trying to speed up the 
  promotion timeline
* Take leadership and more responsibilities during the transition when Namrata
  leaves. Identify weakpoints and potential projects in core infra, draft docs,

  my promo forward.
