# First Zettel of 2023
It is currently 01 Jan 2023, 00:38 UTC-8:00. I have started off my new year on
a strong footing; I completed 45 stories of stair "sprints" as well as 80 out
of 100 burpees (the other 20 I intend to finish after this zettel).

2022 was a strong, but sometimes troubling year for me; there were many successes,
and there were many failures. In 2023, I intend to continue to improve my
circumstances in all aspects of my life. This includes but is not limited by:
* Faith
* Finances
* Fitness
* Leadership
* Relationships

At many points during 2023, I fell weak to my vices. At times I drank too much,
I loosened my diet, and fell victim to other hedonistic tendancies. The instances
for which I can that I lacked discipline were too many. In 2023, God willing, I
will improve.
