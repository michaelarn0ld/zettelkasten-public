# Road to Promotion
Things to be more intentional about:

1. Document everything; document it well. Cut good tickets and add information
so the next person can understand it. Packages should have READMEs good enough
that new developers can bootstrap without help. Wikis should be used to deep
dive usages, known issues, features, and upcoming works. Use design docs to weigh
pros and cons of solutions, explain technical artifacts, and lay out more 
complicated tasks.

2. Onboard other team members onto the projects and take a step back from active
coding, more into consulting and design. Delegate tasks to people instead of
doing the work myself. Then, the team is able to accomplish more.

3. Read the Amazon SDE guidelines once per week and use it as a guide to see
where I find my own gaps. In 1:1s, use the exact words that are layed out in the
official guides to discuss my progression / what is required for the next level

4. Evangelize my work; set up knowledge sharing sessions and design review sessions.
Send emails where applicable to explain how my work is impacting the greater org
and maintain status as a reliable and knowledgable engineer.
