# Perfecting the Resume
Without a great resume, there is no interview. Without great experience, there 
is no great resume. The first step to landing a great interview is to get great
experience

* Shift work responsibilities more toward code
* Build a decent sized software project for fun
* Do academic projects; seek out higher education in CS

All of this things boil down to two things: showing the interviewer that you can
code and that you are smart. Fewer things are more impressive to an interviewer
than a candidate who built something large "just for fun".

## Length
* Strongly advised to keep your resume to 1 page

## Employment History
* Write strong bullets
    - "Accomplished X by implementing Y which led to Z"
    - Ideally show what you did, how you did it, and a measureable result
* Tailor resume to each employer; include only relevant work history and 
experience

## Projects
* Include your 2 most signifcant projects
    - What tech did you use
    - Was it an individual or a team project
    - GitLab repo (if possible)
* Independent projects are generally preferred over course projects, as it shows
initiative
* The most important part about projects is THAT YOU ACTUALLY COMPLETE THEM

## Programming Languages & Technologies
* Be conservative about software that you list; do you really need to list 
IntelliJ? Is it really that hard to learn?
* List languages and tech that you actually feel proficient with; everything is
fair game.
    - Java
    - SQL
    - JavaScript
    - Shell

## Caveats
* Knowing only one or two languages can come off that you are not interested in
tech or you are unexperienced
* Listing specific flavors of languages conveys lack of experience
* Listing a bunch of certifications can also sometimes be a negative, depending
on the company
    - AWS certs may be an exception to this rule
