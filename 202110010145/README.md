# Containers are to Programs as Kubernetes is to Operating System
To get an understanding of containers and their use, make sure to check out:
[202110010028](../202110010028)

## Containers: Images & Runtimes
A container image is a ready to run software package containing everything
needed to run an application. A container runtime is the software responsible
for running container (Docker is an example).


## Kubernetes is the New OS
Kubernetes is an open source distributed system that abstracts the underlying
hardware and makes it easier to run containerized applications at scale. 
Kubernetes, or K8s, treats all machines in a "cluster" ([202110010219](../202110010219))
as a single pool of resources. It takes the role of a distributed OS by
effectively managing the scheduling, allocating the resources, and monitoring
the health of the infrastructure.
