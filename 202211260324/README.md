# Rejection of Modernism, Hedonism, and Pleasurable Pursuits

As I am maturing I am beginning to recognize some of the fatal flaws of my
cohort. One of these is this constant pursuit of pleasure that so many of my
peers seem consumed by.

The value of life is not simply defined by the amount of pleasure one has. Pain
is an important and natural experience that often stimulates periods of growth
within the individual who experiences it.

Rather than reject pain, we should embrace it for the lessons that it teaches and
the experience that it brings. Pain, especially that of emotional descent, will
drive the individual to become a greater version of themselves. Pain breeds progress.
The reason for this is simple; pain is usually rooted in discontent with one's 
current position. It only makes sense for the individual to fight the battles
needed to progress them from such a position. Even in the worst case, the pain
would better allows us to appreciate the pleasurable moments in life.

Pleasure should often, maybe always, be experienced with some caution. It is the
duty of man to analyze the circumstances of his pleasure. What are the consequences?
Will it cause him to falter and become weak? Will it damage his health? 

Ignore all distractions and stay on the path. Crush weakness where it might
exist and embrace the hardships that life is certain to bring.
