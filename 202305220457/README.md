# Personal Goal Philosophy
Everytime you hit your list of goals, you need to quickly come up with 3 more
short-term concrete goals that get you closer to your 10-year plan. The longer
you wait in between goals, the more of a downfall you will experience.

This happens because we let off the gas as we get comfortable in any situation.
Achieving goals makes us feel like we can take a breather. We should not. We
should continue to strive for more.
