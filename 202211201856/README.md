# Reorienting Myself Onto The Path 

## Summary
Breakup with Adi caused a lot of chaos and emotional distress in my life. In the
months leading up to our splitting, I could slowly feel myself drifting from the
path. I was becoming hyper-focused on one thing, my career. While this served me
well for some months as I was getting into the swing of things at Amazon, it is
clear that such direction and imbalance will eventually cause burnout; funny
enough, my tunnel vision on one thing in life will actually eventually lead to
my failure in that ever-important thing.

In the 7 or so weeks immediately following the breakup, I was really in what I
would consider as a rebound phase. I went to concerts, bars, vegas, and overall
participated in a lot of activities that are not in my normal routine. While this
was fun, I think it is time to put a close to this interlude.

Since this year, in all likelyhood I will be spending the holidays alone, I am
going to take advantage of the emotional trauma that I still retain in my heart
and put it to good use. From 11/21/22 until at least the new year (~40 days), I
am going to rededicate myself to the path. I will be rejuvenating my fitness, 
health, and intellectual clarity and (hopefully) carry forth that spirit into
the new year and beyond. In addition to this, I will commit myself to taking 
some leave from work in the Spring of 2023 so that I might go and travel Europe
for some time.

These goals are not well-defined, but rather they are general regions of space
that I want to exist in by the new year. I have found that setting very 
deterministic goals for me has never been an effective strategy (EX: I am going
to spend X hours working out a day and Y hours studying).


## Gym
I will continue what I have started in TX, injuries permitting. This means that
I will try to workout every day until I feel that I need a rest day (generally
5-6 days on, 1-2 days off). My workouts will always start with preworkout, 
cardio (stairs and bike), calisthenics, and then finish with a focused weight 
routine. Additionally, I would like to start doing the sauna after every workout.

Major goals in the gym will be revolving around calisthenics. I want to increase
my volume of pushups, pullups, muscle ups. I want to get better at human flags,
levers, planches, handstands. 

## Diet
I will be following a **mostly** carnivore diet. This means my diet will primarily
consist of meat, fish, eggs, dairy. I will eat fruit (and a lot of it) before and
after workouts. I will start taking dietary supplements as well:
* Fish oil for joints
* Athletic greens for all else
* Creatine for muscle
I will alot myself a bit of wine with dinners, but strictly no beer and no liquor
until at least the new year. I will not be getting drunk and I will not be smoking
nicotine.

I will maintain or even increase my caffeine consumption.

## Fashion
I would like to put an effort into my overall appearance. Eventually, I want
to make new friends and even meet romantic partners. They say that the first
impressions of someone are some of the most important and I tend to agree.

I will take an increased focus on my dress, the cleanliness of my car, my smell
(cologne/deoderant), my skin (lotion, body wash, skin routines), keeping
my facial hair clean and making regular visits to a hair stylist to maintain
my long hair. I will take an audit of my clothes and shoes and make any
adjustments as needed; I will also consider more carefully how I maintain my
wardrobe (washing the clothes and shoes properly)

I will also purchase a nice watch to mark this time in my life.

## Study
I will pick up a new technology and dedicate some free time to learning at least
the basics of it. Recently, I have been fascinated by AR, so I need to determine
what technology (programming language) will be the most useful to master in order
to be a part of that (eventual) revolution. 

I am most strongly considering taking a look at:
- Rust
- C
- C++

Where C or C++ seems like it may be the most immediately useful. Another benefit
of learning one of the mentioned languages is that it will give me more intimate
knowledge of memory management in programming, which is currently an area that I
feel I am sort of lacking.

## Travel
I will make CONCRETE travel plans to leave the U.S. for at least two weeks
before July 2023. Most likely, I will go to Europe. This will require research
and a plan so that I do not aimlessly wander. I would like to go see Europe with
an intention to visit historically significant landmarks
