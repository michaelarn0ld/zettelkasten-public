# Thoughts on Life's Meaning

I am writing this after going through some emotional turmoil. After roughly four
years, my relationship with Adi has come to its' fatal, but imminent end. Such
rare and unpleasant events put one in a position to reflect on some of the deeper
questions that don't normally command much attention.

While I was not perfect in my relationship with Adi, it is eminently clear that
the causes for our demise were her doing. I am not bitter, but writing it down
will allow me to reflect on this at some later time such that I do not make the
same mistakes in the future. My "partner" demonstrated selfish, lack of appreciation,
and unwillingness to compromise throughout the entirety of our relationship. While
I would like to believe that the reason I held on for so long is because I thought
she would change, in reality it is most likely due to some cowardness on my part.
I was young, I made a mistake. It is time to move on.

The last several years of my life has been consumed by "making it"; what is meant
by this is the standard modern American defintion: get a degree, get a good job,
gain some status in life, et cetera. After achieving much of the goals of my late teens and
early 20s, I have realized that the human condition cannot be boiled down and 
satisfied by a check list.

I have found that building relationships, both romantic and platonic, with my
peers has been the most critical component for me in finding some sense of 
fulfillment. This is especially the case when I feel that I am building a 
relationship that is mutually beneficial for both parties. At the same time, I
have also come to appreciate that the meaning of life is not to maximize one's
happiness at all times; sadness, anxiety, lonliness are all important aspects
of the human condition and they teach us to savor the good times. They also
teach us how to reflect on the issues in our own life and they humble us when we
view them through the lens of others who may be experiencing more objectively
troubling hardships.

I will continue to develop expertise over my craft and rejuvenate my dedication
to health and fitness. I will continue to overcome obstacles and become the 
best man that I can become.
