# How to Win Friends and Influence Others

### Six Rules to Win the Hearts of People
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
2. Smile and lead with a friendly demeanor; a firm handshake goes longer than
   you think
3. Remember that a persons name is the sweetest sound that they can hear; 
   remembering a persons name shows that you value them
4. Be a great listener; encourage people to talk about themselves
5. Talk to people about what they are interested in
6. Make people feel important; show admiration sincerely

### How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking
1. Argument is futile, avoid it at all costs; the best way to get something
   positive out of an argument is to avoid it all together. Be diplomatic.
2. Show respect for others' opinions and never assert to someone "you're wrong";
   seek to understand opinions rather than judge them
3. Admit when you are wrong
4. A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. Begin your
   interactions with others in a friendly way. Gentleness is always stronger
   than fury.
