# How to Win Friends and Influence Others

### Six Rules to Win the Hearts of People
1. Become genuinely interested in other people
2. Smile and lead with a friendly demeanor; a firm handshake goes longer than
   you think
3. Remember that a persons name is the sweetest sound that they can hear; 
   remembering a persons name shows that you value them
4. Be a great listener; encourage people to talk about themselves
5. Talk to people about what they are interested in
6. Make people feel important; show admiration sincerely

### How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking
1. Argument is futile, avoid it at all costs; the best way to get something
   positive out of an argument is to avoid it all together. Be diplomatic.
2. Show respect for others' opinions and never assert to someone "you're wrong";
   seek to understand opinions rather than judge them
3. Admit when you are wrong
4. A drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall. Begin your
   interactions with others in a friendly way. Gentleness is always stronger
   than fury.
5. Always seek to start disagreements by getting the other person to agree with
   you; get them saying "yes, yes..." to smaller things instead of "no". You
   do this by finding common ground, which puts them into a state of agreeability.
6. Always let the other person fully and completely express themselves before
   you interject; interuption is egotistical and the other person probably won't
   even be listening to you. Instead, they will be waiting for you to finish so
   they can continue.
