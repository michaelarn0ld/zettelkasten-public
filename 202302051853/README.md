# Why Hardstyle?

Hardstyle is the culmination of a dance music enthusiast's natural progression.
As the listener becomes accustomed to the power, speed, and noise of simpler
subgenres, the energy-inducing properties slowly wane; the craving for something
with greater intensity, something to reinduce the euphoric experience, takes
effect.

The tempo, kicks, and bass which are characteristic of hardstyle draw the
listener into a state of euphoria.

A state of trance.
