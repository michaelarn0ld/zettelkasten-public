# What's a Kubernetes Cluster
A Kubernetes cluster is a set of node machines responsible for running
containerized applications. At a minimum, a cluster contains a control plane and
at least one node (compute machine); the control plane is responsible for
maintaining the desired state of the cluster, what applications are running and
what container images they use. Nodes are the workers, they run the applications
and workloads.
