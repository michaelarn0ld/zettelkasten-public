# Fasting, Dopamine, and Controlling Temptations
I tend to utilize fasting as a means to trim fat from my body; however, I have 
also noticed several other benefits. According to my own anecdotes, I have found
that fasting forces me into a much more fortified headspace. Often times, one's
immediate emotional response will dictate their actions; if one craves food, they
will naturally and immediately satisfy the craving.

When first transitioning into any sustained period of fasting, I have noticed that
there is **always** an initial several weeks of **intense** cravings. Only after
I fight off these raw and primal feelings completely do the benefits of fasting
appear in my life. Such benefits are well understood and include an increase in
mental clarity, boost in energy, and improved physical performance.

Interestingly, there is also an additional (although possibly unintended) benefit
to sustaining a fast. That is, the exercise of denying the cravings in and of
itself builds immense character; being aware that the future bears more fruit and
intentionally delaying immediate gratification is an unnatural and noble pursuit.
This discipline separates men.

The artifacts of this behavior spill into almost all other aspects of life that
involve "pursuing the dopamine hit". Tempations of sexual deviancy, laziness, 
or any other activity that satiates short-term desires at the expense of long-term
glory can only be controlled through sheer masculine will and discipline.

Stay on the path.
