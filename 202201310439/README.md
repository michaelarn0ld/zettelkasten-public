# Big O Notation: Time Complexity
Big O notation denotes the relationship between the runtime of an algorithm and   │  2
the size of its input. In the context of Zettelkasten, we use it in a way that    │  3
is most common across the industry: By trying to offer the tightest description   │  4 ## Tags
of the runtime.                                                                   │  5 #algorithms #bigO
                                                                                  │~
We can discuss the notation in three different ways: best case, worst case, and   │~
expected case. Best case is rarely discussed because it is not that useful;       │~
after all, we can take any algorithm, supply some special input, and get O(1) in  │~
the best case.                                                                    │~
                                                                                  │~
For many algorithms, the worst case and expected case are the same. When they     │~
are different, we need to discuss both. It is important to recognize when this    │~
occurs.
