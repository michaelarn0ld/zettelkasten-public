# 2024 Real Estate

## TODO
* Look to potential real estate markets for real estate purchases (OKC, DES MOINES)
* Research benefits of cash flow + gaining equity + using equity as leverage to
  purchase new properties
* Look at tax strategies
  - 1031 exchange
  - trust -> holding company -> each property in their own LLC
* Does the government incentivise or offer tax advantages for real estate?
* What benefit does real estate have over other investments?
