# Refreshed Approach to Training and Studying
Recently, I just wrapped up a minimal version of a health-tracking java service
to help monitor my progress in the gym as well as my weight and approximate 
body composition.

At the same time, I have been experimenting with several different workout routines
to find something that strikes the balance of rigor and maintainability. I 
believe I have found a suitable candidate: the three-day split. In this way, I
will be able train each muscle group twice per week as well as have 48 hours of
rest in between sessions.

Similarly, I have been experimenting to find the optimum way to regularly increase
my technical skills. Here, I have found the most effective method to be taking 
up personal projects. This kills two birds with one stone; on the one hand, the
completion of a personal project ideally adds some value in the form of usable
software, on the other hand my projects often challenge me to use and learn new
technologies.

I will continue on this path; however, I will also be sure to add some study into
various social media algorithms so that I may leverage my own fitness into a 
side-gig via the internet. If I might help only even one person, it would be
worth the pursuit.
