# 2024 Business Ideas

## Ideas That I Have Some Passion For

Cars
* Exotic car rentals
* Exotic car dealership
* Mobile car detailing; is this possible to do with just a sedan?

Information Technology
* AWS/GCP consultancy firm
* Web development agency
* Software startup
  - MBSE startup
  - JIRA cutting service for CloudWatch logs
  - Using LLM (GPT) for a concept like "Learn X topic in Y mintutes"; simple UI
    w/ 2 input boxes: "What do you want to learn?", "How much time do you have?"

Health
* Meal service company
* Restaurant where you go in and tell them your macros then they prepare a meal
  that meets the macros. It is chipotle style
* Meal prep app. Select meals for week then groceries and recipes are delivered
  to you. Eventually use AI to recommend meals based on your history
* Boutique gym; can we do some research on the Alex Hormozi model?

## Ideas That I Am Not Passionate About

Insurance
* Auto/home/life insurance for individuals
* Commericial insurance
* Clone of Chris Constantini's model

Direct To Consumer
* Beard oil subscription; you get a base and 5 essential oils per quarter. They
  are paired to seasons OR customers can build-their-own bundle
