# Reasons Why People Do Not Achieve What They Set Out To

1.People do not write down their goals and analyze on a daily basis where they
  are in respect to reaching it; their goals are in the clouds rather than front
  of mind

2.People do not utilize their time effectively. They let easy dopamine hits
  consume time they could be using in productive pursuits.

3.People fall off the path and fall into the slippery slope of "it is just one
  donut" or "it is just one day off"


How can I combat this?

1.Write down my goals and keep them front of mind. My most recent goal was to
  acquire the M3. I need to look at my priorities for the year and put another
  goal in the crosshairs. Aiming to do this by the weekend (02/17)

2.Be better about sticking to a general plan for my days; allow time for
  contingencies (AKA don't plan a day minute-by-minute and allow buffer in EVERYTHING)

3.Keep goals time bound; set deadlines for when I need to acheive something by.
  Bonus points if I can break bigger goals into smaller actionable steps with 
  similar timelines.

4.Stop overcommitting to things; learn to tell people NO. On the same token, be
  ready to admit when I am uneducated in something or not in a position to offer
  help. In cases where I do not know the answer, take the time after the fact to
  learn the answer in case it comes up again from another requestor.
