# 10 Year Goals: Community

* I want to find a church where I feel truly at home; I want to be a leader in
  the church community (not clergy) and foster healthy and strong relationships
  with my fellow Christians

* I want to be able to comfortably donate large sums of money to my church in
  pursuit of spreading the gospel and helping those that are in need

* I want to participate in church-driven events like food drives for Thanksgiving
  and food/toy drives for Christmas
