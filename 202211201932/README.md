# Areas For Improving My Relationships With Others

I have been aware for some time now that I am lacking in some interpersonal skills.
Friends, though jokingly, have often described me as cold. In conjunction with
my other goals to bring me back onto the path, I want to rekindle my social 
spirit.

As part of this, I would do the following:

* Make a conscious effort to make relationships and introduce myself to people
that I don't know in social situations. This will involve fighting past awkwardness
and keeping the conversation going until I feel like I have at least some friendly
chemistry with the previous stranger. The conversation should be full enough that
it is easy for me to remember the person's name after we are done talking.

* If extended eye contact with someone, or any chemistry is felt for durations, I
should muster up the courage to interact with the person and attempt for a
conversation like mentioned in the point above. I need to be more comfortable 
with the risk/reward of rejection/acceptance

* I should give non-intrusive and genuine compliments to humans that I want to
get to know better. My first impression (and thus my appearance) matters a lot 
for this; I do not want to make people feel uncomfortable or in some way that I
am trying to get something from them. I feel that rekindling such interactions
will give me the opportunity to meet interesting people and hopefully make new
friends

* I will connect with people who share similar interests to me
