# Thoughts on My First Quarter-Century

Happy 25th birthday to me, from me

* The thing in life that brings the most joy is sharing memories with others
* It is most valuable to you when you provide the most value to others
* If you want to get good at something in life, you have to put in the time
* There are only 24 hours in a day; choose few things and master those
* The fact that life is finite is scary but it gives every moment value
* Good health is often taken for granted; always prioritize being healthy
* God acts in ways that men cannot understand; it is futile to try to understand
