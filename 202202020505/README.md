## Weaknesses
* Never answer "My greatest weakness is that I work too hard"; this comes off
as arrogant and/or you won't admit your faults
* "Sometimes, I try to over-engineer solutions; while that can be an asset in
improving the performance and maintainability of my projects, it also means that
sometimes I get into the weeds on a problem that is not mission-critical. Due to
this, I always make sure to realign with the project goals when I find myself
spending a disproporitonate amount of time on a feature"

## Questions to Ask Interviewer
* Genuine Questions
    - Questions you actually want to know the answers to.
    - "What is the ratio of testers to devlopers to program managers? What is
    the workflow between them like and how does project planning happen on the 
    team"
    - "What has been the most challenging aspect of your job?"
* Insightful Questions
    - Questions that show your knowledge of the tech
    * "I noticed you use technology X, how do you handle problem Y"
    * "Why did you use protocol A over protocal B; I know it has benefits X, Y,
    Z, but many companies choose not to use it because of D"
* Passion Questions
    * Questions that show your passion for tech; they show you are interested in
    learning and will be a strong contributor.
    * "I am interested in security/cloud, and I would love the opporunity to learn
    more about it. What opportunities are there at this company to learn about it"
* Ask one or more from each of the above categories

## Know Your Technical Projects
    * Deeply master your techincal projects
    * Focus on projects that:
        - Had challenging components
        - You played a central role in
        - You can talk at technical depth about
    * Talk about design decisions, challenges, mistakes, and choice of 
    technologies.
    * For all of the above, do not just talk about the what, also discuss the
    why.

## Responding to Behavioral Questions
* Be specific, not arrogant; this means strictly give the most accurate 
description of the objective facts and then let the interviewer derive their
own interpretation of what it means. If they have follow-up questions, they'll
ask
* Limit details; stay light on the deep technical details and focus on the key
points. When possible, try to translate it and explain the impact
    - "I chose to switch algorithm X for Y to reduce search from O(N) to
    O(Log N) for 90% of cases. I can go into more details if you would like"
* Focus on yourself, not the team; replace "us", "we", "the team" with "I"; talk
about places where YOU had the most impact
* Give structured answers
    - S.A.R.
    - Nugget

## S.A.R. and Nugget
* S.A.R. - Situation, Action, Result
    - Outline the situation, explain actions, describe the result
    - Situation and result should be succint, just enough to give context
    - Action is the meat; where possible try to break the action into multiple
    parts to encourage sufficicent depth into each aspect
    - Think about what personality attributes you S.A.R. stories convey. Are
    they aligned with how you want to present yourself?
    - The attributes should be clear but not explicit; "I made sure to call the
    client myself because I knew that he would appreciate hearing it from me
    directly" -> Empathy and Courage
* Nugget First - Start your response with a "nugget" that succinctly describes
your response will entail
    - "Sure, let me tell you about a time where I convinced my school to let
    undergraduates teach their own course..."

## "So, tell me about yourself..."
* Current Role (Headline)
* College
* Post College & Onwards
* Current Role (Details)
* Outside of Work
* Wrap Up
