# Reorienting Myself Onto The Path II

## TLDR
Thanksgiving 2023 served as a really good checkpoint for me; up until now I feel
that there has been a slow creep of angst since summer. Mostly fueled by not
dealing with work an unplanned return to some of my older, more debaucherous
habits.

Nothing is purely chaotic; however the week leading up to Thanksgiving was sort
of an unplanned deloading week where I kinda let go in all aspects. I was drinking,
I was not working as hard, I was not on the bike, I smoked cigarettes, I was off
my normal diet, I was not training as hard.

The slow churn of summer festivals and lack of a goal-oriented path since my
encounters with Chelsey may have caused this, but realistically I am the one to
blame. I need to reorder my life.

Order of priority is:
* Work
* Diet + Training -> [202311250238](../202311250238) - German Volume Training II
* Dating -> [202311260454](https://github.com/michaelarn0ld/zettelkasten-private/tree/main/202311260454)
* Fun
* Education [TODO Zettel]


## Work
For the remainder of 2023 and going into 2024 I want to get more serious about
promotion within Amazon. Some concrete steps I can do to work toward this and
become more of a leader within the org are:

1. Document everything in JIRA; organize JIRAs into appropriate epics/stories
2. Backfill my work with design documents and create design documents for all
non-trivial code from this point forward
3. Create wikis for projects and features that I am an SME on. When bugs arise
and there can be an SOP for it that someone else can follow, then I should add 
it to the wiki and direct engineers there first (speak with Namrata on this)
4. Leave feedback on other people's design documents and get more involved in the
design decisions

Beyond this, I should continue to show up in office as much as possible and be
a friendly face while I am there. I should strive to mend any relationships if I
sense that something is off or if I am being too aggressive. I should always be
conscious of my perception while at work.

In my 1:1 conversations, I should be a little bit more direct and have a better
structure. This is loose and subject to change, but maybe it should go something
like this:

1. Salutations 
2. What is going on currently + my current projects 
3. Identify state of the org and projects I can involve in to get more exposure
4. Identify and check up on my strengths + gaps 
5. Free time, any information that manager needs to share with me 

I am 1.75 years into my tenure at Amazon and I have read that anecdotally that 
on average that the promotion to L5 can occur after 2.5 years. On top of all of 
the above, I should continually read the internal role expectations and guidelines
to make sure to personally myself identify any gaps in the promotion.

## Diet
The holidays threw me off the path for a little bit. I have not been able to eat
that many fruits or vegetables for about a week. When I return to the Bay Area,
I will resume on my diet. 

My diet will be focused on whole foods. I will comfortably eat butter, olive oils,
and minimally processed foods.

I will have a protein focused diet, with the majority of my protein coming from
chicken, eggs, yogurt, and cheese (in that order). I will supplement with powder
and protein drinks where needed.

Beyond protein, the second most important components of my diet will be fruit. 
Given that it is winter, I will probably mostly eat apples, bananas, and oranges.
I will limit the amount of dried fruit that I eat and eat less of it than I 
normally do (causes stomach distress).

I will eat rice and potatoes as well with my chicken as a starch; I will not
combine the two or eat more than one type of starch in a single meal. I will
only consume bread either at a restaurant or if I bake it myself (or purchase)
locally. Bread on butter is OK, but jam should be limited.

I will limit alcohol completely to dates and partying. 

## Training
Again, the holidays have completely thrown me off my program. This and the unplanned
stresss of biking during the work week with minimal sleep have been creating a 
situation where my workouts have been lackluster. I need to get to a situation
where I can comfortably bike and workout 6 days a week. I would also like to be
shredded again as I feel it will help in other areas of life.

I will bike 75 miles a week.

I will workout 6 days a week; I will follow a variation of GVT and on the 6th
day I will have a calisthenics focused workout. The next zettel after this one
will describe my workout program -> [202311250238](../202311250238) - German Volume Training II

I will involve 10mins of HIIT cardio into each weightlifitng session; thus I will
do 1 hour of HIIT per week.

## Fun
This will be a short section. I have been partying frequently but not with any
hard boundaries. I have been in control, but I think it will be useful to set some
hard lines going forward.

I will cosnume alcohol/others  at most 2 weeks in a calendar month. Dates with
new women in general will not count towards this since I am differentiating a 
glass of wine to break the ice from the degeneracy of a rave.

## Dating
I have been relatively relaxed about this since I have broken up with Adi. There
was a period of time where I unblocked her on socials but I found myself consumed
with her posts. I was not really missing her consciously; however, I was just
curious. This was a bad idea since I started having weird dreams about her again.
I have since cut everything off completely again and do not intend to reopen the
channel as it has zero value.

In the last year I have had "encounters" with 4 women and all of them resulted in
nothing. Part of me feels a bit weird about these short relationships because they
were a bit too passionate/involved without any real commitment. I guess for some
men that this might be ok, but in my situation it actually contributes to the
loneliness. I am open to short relationships, but I will not seek them as I have
done before.

When I go out into public, I will make sure that I am well groomed and well dressed.
I will take advantage of dating apps, bars, and other social outings to try to
regularly meet women. Generally I feel that I am actually already meeting enough
women on a regular basis; however, I just have not been super active about it
and as a result I have not been overwhelmingly interested in the women that I 
have met.

I will make a conscious effort to be friendly with more people and to extend 
genuine compliments. My mom's neighbor Jared, and his loneliness, is a cautionary
tale of what can happen if you do not make yourself uncomfortable. Attractive
women make me uncomfortable, but not for the fear of rejection. There is some 
other hidden fear that I don't quite understand. I reject this fate and thus I 
need to be more proactive when it comes to meeting people. I will make a conscious
effort to do this for both men and women.

Dating is hard, and like anything else in life that is hard it requires time and
bandwidth to get results. I will follow up on this topic in another zettel 
(either today or tomorrow) in the private zettelkasten.

## Education
I want to pick up Rust programming; I have given Go a shot on more than one 
occassion and have always found some issues with starting a project with it.

I need to start a side project that I can work on and develop using Rust. I have
a few ideas for some apps but ideally I can build a full application end to end
using Rust for the server and Svelte for the client side stuff. In a future zettel
(today or tomorrow) I will explore some side projects and ideally come to some
conclusion and start the repository.
