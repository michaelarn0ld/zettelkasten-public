# Java: 4 Pillars of OOP

1. Encapsulation
    * distillation of a concept into a discrete set of data and behaviors; 
    related to the single responsibility principle. A well written class
    encapsulates what it means to be a thing - it is understandable and easy to
    use

1. Inheritance
    * This is a form of reuse based on "this-is-a-that" relationships. We say
    that a child or subclass extends a parent or superclass. When a child extends
    a parent, it gains access to all non-private fields and methods as members.

1. Polymorphism
    * When one or more subclasses override a super-class's method or implement
    an interface, their behavior is said to be polymorphic (the overwritten 
    method is polymorphic or the class/interface). All types have the same
    method signature, but the outcomes are different.

1. Abstraction
    * Abstraction is the principle of revealing only the essential characteristics
    of a type - the gory details are hidden in private fields and methods. A
    beautiful abstraction makes complicated data types easy to use, it prevents
    the user from the mental expense of juggling "what is happening under the hood"
