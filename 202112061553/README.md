# Java: Intro to OOP

* the ```new``` operator instantiates an object. Instantiation is the process of
providing any data, if neccessary, to construct a new instance of an object.

* Different instances of objects stand alone as independent objects and do not
share state

* Objects are useful because they contain a limited set of behaviors and state;
they simplify software development through abstraction

* In Java, definitions for object state and behavior are stored in a ```class```
which specifies the data that make up each object instance. It defines allowable
behavior.

* Classes are composite data types; it is made up of other data types. A
```Pet``` object might be made of ```String name``` and ```String animal```

* Classes can be composed of other composite data types as well. A ```Phone```
might be made of ```String kind``` and ```String number```. A ```Contact``` may
be made of ```Phone phone``` and ```String name```.

* A class is a template for an object; an object is an instance of a class
