## Basic Criteria
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### BUDGET
* $3000/month

* 600+ sqft.
* Decent kitchen
* Space for my couch

### AMENITIES
* Dedicated non-street parking
* Onsite laundry

## Ideal Neighborhoods
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### RICHMOND DISTRICT
I like the area because it is residential in nature; it is also located between
GGP and the presidio. It is better than the sunset district for me as well b/c
I get the feeling that it is more centrally located to excitement in the city

Addresses:
* 590 4th Ave
* 565 8th Ave

### SUNSET DISTRICT
I like the area because it is residential and feels peaceful. I think that it is
the quietest of the neighborhoods that I am shooting for and that it will be the
most comfortable to live in.

Addresses:
* 1215 47th Ave
* 1285 48th Ave
* 1200 Irving St

### NOE VALLEY
This neighborhood feels more lively than richmond but less so than haight. I had
good vibes in the neighborhood and felt it was very walkable. Seems like its a 
bit further from other areas of the city but has its own charm.

Addresses:
* 120 Portola Dr
* 3911 24th St

### HAIGH-ASHBURY
Very lively neighborhood with a lot going on; this could be a very fun place to
live as it has so much character. On the other side, it was the least clean of 
all the places that we visited but not really in a bad way. Overall, a very 
exciting neighborhood.

Addresses:
* 520 Clayton St
* 616 Cole St
* 675 Cole St

### TWIN PEAKS / FOREST HILL / MIDTOWN TERRACE
Great views and seemed like there were a good amount of residential apartment
complexes up there. It might become a pain to ride the bike up and down those
hills every day; however on the flip side I would get super shredded.

Addresses:
* 298 Portola Dr
* 150 Portola
* 160 Portola
* 3450 Market
* 3550 Market
* 3649 Market
* 610 Clipper
* 5084 Diamond Heights

## Secondary Neighborhoods

### LAUREL HEIGHTS

* 75 Heather Ave Unit 11 

### THE CASTRO
Need more data

Addresses:
* 59 Hattie St

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Fallback Neighborhoods
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### SOMA + Mission Bay
More dicey street by street down here and does not have the same SF charm as 
the other neighborhoods; sound pollution due to freeway proximity. Benefit here
is the easy access to caltrain + the abundance of new apartments

### MISSION
Lot of culture and energy in the mission; however I always feel a bit unsafe 
walking around out here, especially when I am near the BART stations. On the
bright side, the crowd down here feels younger and more fun than other areas,
so my nightlife would be exciting. Low on my list due to the lack of cleanliness
and lack of residential feel.
