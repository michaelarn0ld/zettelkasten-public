# Zettelkasten
The Zettelkasten Method is a knowledge management method coined by German social
scientist, Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann, who published 50 books and more than 600
articles, credited his success to his unique collection of notes stored in his
Zettelkasten, or "slip box" in German.The primary purpose of a Zettelkasten is
to increase the productivity and usefulness notetaking.

Standard note taking requires a massive amount of forethought into the structure
and organization of a given collection. Often times, this results in arbitrary
folder names that are only useful at the very moment they are defined. Over time,
this results in two major problems; first, it confines your thoughts to
the bounds of the folder title. Second, and consequential of the first, as your
library of notes grows, so does the complexity of the folder structure,
eventually becoming disorderly and difficult to navigate.

A Zettelkasten solves these problems by taking an elegant and simple approach to
notetaking. Instead of creating folders ahead of the actual notes, we do away
with that and opt for a system of ***hypertext***. The key feature of a
hypertext is that it is easily surfable; for example, on Wikipedia, you simply
click links to get to the next article.

There are many reasons why a Zettelkasten can significantly improve knowledge
management:

* Improves the connectivity of thoughts and and naturally reveals new links in
ideas
* Increase the productivity of note-taking by providing clear guidelines for
**all** notes
* Prevents time wasted on architecting note structure ahead of time
* Provides an interface to easily navigate and revisit old thoughts

The value of one's Zettelkasten grows with time; over long periods, clusters of 
hyperlinked ideas **will** gradually connect and create a web of surfable
knowledge.


## How My Zettelkasten Is Structured
A Zettelkasten is a personalized tool for optimizing thinking and writing. It is 
not meant to serve as a repository for final drafts, but rather a place to store
unedited ideas as they come. My requirements for a Zettel (note) are:

* Must be short, typically less than one page
* Must be uniquely identified by the date and time at which they were created
* Must contain tags that identify one or more general topics to which the Zettel
belongs

The typical Zettel is structured something like this:
```bash
# Title
|-- objective and/or purpose
|
|-- ## Question 1 or Topic 1
|---- answer 1 or response 1
|
|-- ## Question 2 or Topic 2
|---- answer 2 or response 2
|
|-- ## Question n or Topic n
|---- answer n or response n
|
|-- ## Related
|---- related zettels
|
|-- ## Tags
|---- one or more tags to find this zettel
```


This system works very well for me as the tags provide an easy interface for me
to quickly decide whether or not to link to Zettels. The typical creation of one
of my Zettels goes something like: 

1. Write down the thought while it is still fresh in my mind
1. Think of and add tags that describe the content of the Zettel
1. Search my Zettelkasten for Zettels with matching tags
1. Link matching Zettels that I find relevant to the current topic

Of course, this is not the only method. The most important thing is finding a 
system that works best for you! Check out the references for more.
