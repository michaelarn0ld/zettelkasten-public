# Java: Questions on Strings

Q: Is a string variable just a pointer to a sequence of characters underneath
the hood?
A:

Q: On a 64-bit computer, does this mean that the maximum size that any given
primitive type can be allocated is 64 bits? How is this related to the size of
the "word"?
A:

Q: How much memory is allocated to char; if 16-bit, does this mean that each 
CPU "word" can contain 4 characters? Then a 12 character string will reference
a sequence of 3-words in memory?
A:

Q: The default value for reference types is null; does this mean that a reference
type that is declared but not assigned a value is null? What about primitive types?
What are their default values?
A:

Q: Does the String.replace(this, withThat) method replace all instances of "this"
with "withThat"
A:

Q: Say there is int a = 8 and int b = 8; we may say that a == b evaluates true;
does this mean that a comparison on primitive types compares values and not
position in memory? Similarly, does this imply that ***all*** reference types
are strictly equal if and only if they reference the same space in memory?
A:
