# Simple Philosophy on Projects

The ideal type of project to take up is one that is:
* high impact
* low-hanging fruit

Typically, these types of projects have relatively simple solutions. Thus, the
impact vs. time-spent is optimized. The more of these opportunities you can find,
the more overall impact you can make with your life.

notice the importance of impact.
